### Inspirations:

Inspired by the LTree from Prof. Kate Compton, I want to build some trees with more cool lookings and different sliders from the starter code.

### What is your generative space? (ie, what kinds of things can this generate?)

This can generate many tree-like things, such as windmill, bouquet, bald trees and normal trees.

Music is not implemented.

### What do each of the sliders do?

shining: the width of the shiny edges of branches
trunkColor: the color of the branches
trunkThickness: the thickness of the branches
treeLeaning: how the tree leans
branchSpread: angle between different branches of the same trunk
flowerHue: color of flowers
flowerShape: shape of flowers, more sharp or more square.
flowerSize: size of flowers.

### One related thought from the reading:

There is unlimited imagination and fun when trying to visualize a vector in an artistic way, but this assignment only uses vectors with fixed small length. I think it would be more interesting to use longer or non-fixed length vectors or even multidimensional matrix/array.
