### Inspirations:

Make a scene of the sea, including fishes, bubbles, etc.

### Particle system 1: Basic Particle System

* What you were going for:

    Display various of fishes using emojis.
    
* Which starter code you used:

    Basic-particles.js

* Where does this particle type get its forces:

    heart gravity, attraction, drag

* What sliders you made:

    heartGravity, heartDrag, heartAttraction

* What debug visualization:

    show force (acceleration) with blue arrow, velocity in green arrow.
 
### Particle system 2: Wind Particle System

* What you were going for:

    Display bubbles and water-flow underwater.
    
* Which starter code you used:

    Wind-particles.js

* Where does this particle type get its forces:

    Bubbles get their force from wind

* What sliders you made:

    temperature (how strong the wind is)

* What debug visualization:

    show wind in white lines.
 

### Particle system 3: Spring Particle System

* What you were going for:

    Display shining bubbles.
    
* Which starter code you used:

    Spring-particles.js

* Where does this particle type get its forces:

    A particle gains force from other particles that are connected to it, through springs

* What sliders you made:

    springStrength, springEase

* What debug visualization:

    show the connections (springs) and force between particles.

### One related thought from the reading:
* "A significant property of life-like behavior is unpredictability over moderate time scales. For example at one moment, the boids in the applet above might be flying primarily from left to right. It would be all but impossible to predict which direction they will be moving (say) five minutes later. At very short time scales the motion is quite predictable: one second from now a boid will be traveling in approximately the same direction. This property is unique to complex systems and contrasts with both chaotic behavior (which has neither short nor long term predictability) and ordered (static or periodic) behavior. This fits with Langton's 1990 observation that life-like phenomena exist poised at the edge of chaos."
* From Boids (https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)

Thought: This property of life-like behavior (short-time predictable and moderate-time unpredictable) are common in many group animals/fishes/etc,. If we can simulate or quantify the short-time behavior, it would be more possible to estimate or understand the chaos of the whole group in long time.
