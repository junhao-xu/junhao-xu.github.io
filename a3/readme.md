### One related thought from the reading:

Quate from Kate Compton's dissertation:

I propose four new modes of interactive drawing in an autotelic experience, to provide alternatives to the traditional one of representational sketching.

12.2.1 Conformance
The first mode is conformance. In this mode, the user is making marks, but they are making marks according to a pre-established goal. Success at this activity is measured not by creativity, but by conformance to the guidelines.

12.2.2 Operational
In operational drawing, the user draws in order to control some action external to the drawing.

12.2.3 Accumulative
A drawing system can be an accumulative record of actions or forces.3 In this mode, there is an interesting set of forces operating on the world, and the movement caused by those forces leaves a visible record of markings behind.

12.2.4 Transformational
The final kind of drawing mode is transformational, where the strokes created by the user are somehow transformed or elaborated on by a generative system.
