# A9 - Costumes
## Junhao Xu

### Inspirations:

Draw a Cyberpunk style face with bright color and simple lines and curves.

### What does your costume represent (or what vibe does it have)?

It is a modern, cyberpunk, changeable and colorful costume in a fast-moving tunnel background.

### What do each of the sliders do?

earSize: Change the size of both ears
zoom: zoom in or zoom out the whole face
eyeColor: Change the color of both eyes
tunnelColor: Change the color of the tunnel background


### One related thought from the reading:

I think costumes are not only for creating unique faces for everyone, but also for carrying a variety of different cultures. Many cultures on earth have their ways and styles to make costumes, and it would be greate to build them on webpages.
